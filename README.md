# Hello and Welcome!

<p align="left"> I'm Jeisson Pulido and I am currently a First Year at the University of Southern California. I am particularly interested in Cosmology/Astrophysics and I have had a few research experiences in both experimental and data-driven Astronomy. I also served as a high school and college tutor in many subjects, mostly on Calculus and Lower Division Physics. This website should give a short overview of my current work, so please feel free to explore this page. </p>
